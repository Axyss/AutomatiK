Hi, I'm <b>Axyss</b>, the developer of this project, in this document I'll be talking about why I've been updating so much AutomatiK
recently, how I plan to get rid of the updates and the future of the project.

<h2>The updates</h2>

First of all, let's talk about the updates, the reason why I release so many updates is Epic Games, since they don't have a public API,
the only way the bot has to get the game data is by <b>requesting It directly to the web page</b>. This makes the requests
very susceptible if the structure of the JSON files the web uses to store game information changes. And that's what has been
ocurring during the past months, minimal changes in the structure that broke completely the detection of free games from Epic.

In other words, imagine you have a friend that moves in requently and you want to visit him, but %&@$, he moved in again and
you need to get his new adress or you won't be able to visit him anymore.

The idea to solve this problem?, program an auto-updater in order to make the updating process less tedious. I'll start working on
It soon.

<h2>The future of the project</h2>

As you have already seen, I release minor updates quite often, and <b>I don't plan to stop doing It any time soon</b>. However, I
would like to create some major updates to improve some parts and code new modules to make AutomatiK support new platforms.

I also want to remember that If you have any <b>suggestion</b>, you can leave them in the <b>Issue</b> tab and use the
"suggestion" label.
