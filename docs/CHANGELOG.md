## Unreleased (since v1.3.2)

### ✨ New Features

- **Steam support** — Steam is now a fully supported platform for detecting free game promotions.
- **Ubisoft support** — Ubisoft has been added as a new supported platform.
- **IGDB integration** — Game data is now enriched using the IGDB API, providing enhanced metadata such as ratings and cover art.
- **AI-powered parsing fallback** — When standard parsing fails, AutomatiK can now use Google Gemini as a fallback method for extracting game data.
- **Rich embed notifications** — Free game announcements now include promotional images, service logos, and improved embed formatting.
- **Slash commands** — All commands have been migrated from prefix-based commands to Discord slash commands, organized into cogs.
- **Interactive language selection** — The `/language` command now features interactive Discord components (dropdowns) instead of a plain list.
- **Unified `/channel` command** — The old `select`/`unselect` commands have been replaced by a single `/channel` management command with interactive components.
- **Unified `/services` command** — The `enable`, `disable`, and `service` commands have been merged into a single `/services` command with interactive components.
- **Per-server language support** — Each server can now independently choose its language; missing translations fall back to English automatically.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

### 🏗️ Architecture & Refactoring

- **BaseService pattern** — All services now extend a `BaseService` class, providing a consistent interface and automatic `SERVICE_ID` assignment.
- **Modules renamed to Services** — The internal terminology has changed from "modules" to "services" to avoid confusion with Python modules.
- **Project restructuring** — Major reorganization of the codebase for better maintainability.
- **Environment-based configuration** — Configuration has been migrated from JSON/YAML files to `.env` environment variables.
- **Docker support** — Added `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment with MongoDB.
- **Self-bot support removed** — AutomatiK no longer supports running as a self-bot.
